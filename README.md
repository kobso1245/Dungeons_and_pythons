#Done things list:
 - Dungeon can be imported from a file
 - Dungeon can be generated randomly
 - Hero can move freely in the dungeon
 - Hero can detect Enemies, Walls and Treasures
 - Dungeon's map can be printed
 - Treasures are randomly picked
 - Written tests for the hero movement

#To do list for the Dungeon class:
 - Make the actual Enemies and Treasures on the map
 - Make the Enemies be random
 - Add couple more spawn points on the map so the Hero can respawn(still thinking if this is actually a good idea or not)

#To do list for all other classes:
 - Tweak the Hero, Enemy, Treasure, Weapon and Spell class
 - Test em and make sure they are all working properly
 - Stop being lazy AND START WRITING TESTS or the universe might implode..
 - Make Hero and Enemy inheritate from a single class(better code-readability)
 - Do same as above for the Weapon and Spell class
 - Write tests...
 - Fix all the errors
 - Write tests again...
 - Make sure it all works now
 - Do the Fight class
